## 🎮 What is Yuga Odysseys?

**Yuga Odysseys** is an **infinite learning platform** with civilization-building game mechanics. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, learners rebuild civilization by mastering knowledge across **24 comprehensive domains** - from basic survival skills to cutting-edge research.

> *"What if learning felt like saving the world?"*

### The Concept

In a world recovering from collapse, **knowledge is your only tool**. You're not memorizing facts - you're solving real dilemmas:

- *"Your AI can predict market crashes but will harm others - what do you do?"*
- *"Two villages need water. One has sick children, the other has crops dying. Who gets priority?"*
- *"A friend shares fake news that supports your beliefs. How do you respond?"*

Every challenge connects **ancient Indian wisdom** to **modern applications**.
