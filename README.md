## 🎮 What is Yuga Odysseys?

**Yuga Odysseys** is an **infinite learning platform** with civilization-building game mechanics. Set in a post-apocalyptic future, you rebuild civilization by mastering knowledge across **24 comprehensive domains** - learning from the mistakes of the past to build a better world.

> *"What if learning felt like saving the world?"*

### 🌍 The Meta-Narrative

**You are in the future.** Civilization has collapsed. An event known as **"The Great Forgetting"** destroyed most human knowledge - libraries burned, institutions crumbled, wisdom was scattered.

The twist? **The "past" is our present.** The old world had all the knowledge it needed - sustainable farming, ethical governance, inner peace practices, scientific thinking - but failed to apply it wisely. Greed won over wisdom. Short-term over long-term. Division over unity.

**Your mission**: Recover this lost knowledge and rebuild civilization *the right way*. You're not just learning history - you're learning **what went wrong** so you can **build what should have been**.

This is the transition from **Kali Yuga** (Age of Darkness) to **Satya Yuga** (Age of Truth) - a concept from Hindu cosmology where humanity cycles through ages of wisdom and ignorance. You are the bridge.

### The Gameplay

You're not memorizing facts - you're solving real dilemmas that echo the mistakes of the past:

- *"Your AI can predict market crashes but will harm others - what do you do?"*
- *"Two villages need water. One has sick children, the other has crops dying. Who gets priority?"*
- *"A friend shares fake news that supports your beliefs. How do you respond?"*

Every challenge connects **ancient Indian wisdom** to **modern applications** - because the answers were always there. We just forgot to listen.

### 🏰 Settlement Building

Watch your civilization grow as you master knowledge:
- **72 unique buildings** (3 per domain)
- Buildings unlock through story arcs
- Visual representation of your learning journey
- From ruins → thriving civilization

### 📖 58 Curated Story Arcs

Handcrafted narrative journeys across four categories:

**🌱 Survival & Foundation** (15 arcs)
> *"The First Harvest"* - Your settlement is starving. You find seeds in the ruins, but the soil is barren. Rediscover sustainable agriculture, understand ecosystems, and organize fair distribution.

**🧠 Wisdom & Meaning** (14 arcs)
> *"Finding Peace in Chaos"* - Survivors are traumatized, angry, hopeless. Discover meditation practices, philosophical frameworks, and psychological healing to restore inner peace.

**🤝 Community & Society** (14 arcs)
> *"Who Decides?"* - Your growing settlement needs rules. But who makes them? Design fair governance, establish justice systems, and prevent the tyranny that destroyed the old world.

**🔬 Knowledge & Progress** (15 arcs)
> *"Rediscovering Science"* - Superstition is spreading. Some blame "cursed technology" for the collapse. Recover the scientific method and separate fact from fear.

Each arc:
- 8-15 challenges with connected narrative
- Spans 2-4 knowledge domains
- Unlocks buildings upon completion
- Sequential unlocking ensures proper knowledge building

### 📊 Adaptive Difficulty

**D1 (Age 10) → D10 (PhD Research)**

Same domain, infinite depth:
- A 12-year-old beginner and a 45-year-old professional both start at Level 1
- Progress at your own pace
- Merit-based advancement, not age-gated
